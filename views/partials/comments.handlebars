    {{!--  the comments array can't be destructured into an easily accessed variable name
    because the comments array is the parent being passed into the template.
    In Handlebars.js, we can use the trusty keyword this to refer to the parent 
    object or array that's available in the context of the partial. Data that's 
    passed to a template file is technically always part of this, but when dealing with 
    objects, we can simply access the object properties directly (e.g., vote_count 
    instead of this.vote_count).

        {{!-- Now all we have to do to use our custom helper functions in the templates is add 
        them to the Handlebars.js expressions.
        This works essentially the same way as calling format_date(created_at).
